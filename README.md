# ECG Classification for Remote Health Monitoring

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of my capstone project focused on ECG signal classification to improve **remote health monitoring**, addressing challenges like **class imbalance** and **computational efficiency**. The project leverages machine learning techniques like **Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN)** and **XGBoost** to classify heart conditions from the **ECG5000** dataset.

> Achieved a **macro F1 score of 0.6546 (TCN)** and **0.5785 (XGBoost)** using innovative data augmentation, feature engineering, and interpretable model design.

> Achieved the highest score (95/100) among 20 participants for this project

This work showcases skills in data analysis, preprocessing, machine learning, and model optimization‚Äîideal for roles in **Data Science**, **Data Engineering**, **ETL Development**, and **ML Engineering**.

## üö© Project Highlights

### üîß Problem Solved
Addressed **extreme class imbalance** in ECG5000 (e.g., class 4: 11 samples vs. class 0: 781) to enable accurate detection of **rare heart conditions**, crucial for remote diagnostics.

### Methodologies

- **Method A (TCN):**  
  Implemented a lightweight TCN with data augmentation (odd-even sampling, amplitude shifting).  
  - **Macro F1:** 0.6546  
  - **Accuracy:** 0.9206  

- **Method B (XGBoost):**  
  Developed interpretable features (e.g., `permutation_entropy`, `simple_angle`)  
  - **Macro F1:** 0.5785 (vs. baseline 0.4109, a **+41.2% improvement**)  
  - **Accuracy:** 0.8767  

- **Method C (KNN):**  
  Baseline method with limited ability to handle imbalance.  
  - **Macro F1:** 0.5681  
  - **Accuracy:** 0.9220  

### üí° Key Innovations

- Novel **odd-even sampling** and **amplitude shifting** to address minority class underrepresentation.
- Custom feature engineering (`simple_angle`, `maxMinMore`) for interpretable ECG analysis.
- Post-processing override (`overridePredict`) to boost minority class predictions.

> üí° Impact: Models designed for **low-power devices**, enabling deployment in **rural healthcare** scenarios.
